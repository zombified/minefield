This is a game based on the Dodger game from [Invent With Python](http://inventwithpython.com/chapter20.html).

It is a game intended to highlight basic usage of the [melonJS](http://www.melonjs.org) framework. A corresponding series of blog posts about creating this game can be found on [my blog](http://joelkleier.com/blog/category/minefield/).
